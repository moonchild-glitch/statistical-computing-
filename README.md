The code examples in this repository demonstrate the following concepts:

1. **Arithmetic Operators** - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation
2. **Relational Operators** - Comparison operations (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
3. **Logical Operators** - Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT)
4. **Assignment Operators** - Variable assignment and reassignment
5. **Type Checking** - Verifying data types
6. **Special Values** - Handling infinity, NaN, and missing values
7. **Type Conversions** - Converting between different data types
8. **Built-in Constants** - Using mathematical constants like π
9. **Variables** - Creating and managing variables
10. **Vectors/Arrays** - Working with collections of values
11. **Vector Operations** - Element-wise operations on vectors
12. **Boolean Comparisons** - Logical operations on vectors
13. **Floating-point Precision** - Understanding numerical precision limitations

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A learning resource for students studying statistical computing
- A comparative guide for understanding syntax differences across Python, R, and Julia
- Reference material for basic mathematical and statistical operations
- A foundation for more advanced statistical computing concepts

## Usage

Each file can be run independently in its respective environment:

- **Python**: `python BasicsOfData/math_operations.py`
